## 1. The Standards:
A standard is a set of rules that determines how something must be done. Networking and internet standards unsure that all devices connecting to the network implement the same set of rules or protocols on the same manner. Using standards, it is possible for different types of devices to send information to each other over the internet. If one person sends an email via a personal computer, another person can use a mobile phone to receive and read the email as long as the mobile phone uses the same standards as the personal computer.

## 2. Network Standards Organizations:
When a new standard is proposed, each stage of the development and approval process is recorded in a numbered Request for Comments (RFC) document so that the evolution of the standard is tracked. RFCs for internet standards are published and managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
