## 1. Network Protocols:
A computer message is actually made up of several protocols.
In this message here we have:
- The Ethernet protocol governs network interface card to network interface card in the same network.
- Internet protocol (IP) governs communication from the original source all the way to the final destination.
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) makes sure that the information gets there reliably. And if it arrives out of order, if there's a sequence of packets all associated with the same message, it makes sure that they get re-ordered properly.
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) governs the exchange or transfer of HTML.

| Ethernet | IP  | TCP | HTTP |
| -------- | --- | --- | ---- |

## 3. The TCP/IP Model:

| TCP/IP Model Layer | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application        | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control.          |
| Transport          | Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks. |
| Internet           | Determines the best path through the network.                           |
| Network Access     | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the internet.      |
## 4. The OSI References Model:

| OSI Model Layer | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7-Application   | The application layer contains protocols used for process-to-process communications.                                                                                                                                |
| 6 -Presentation | The presentation layer provides for common representation of the data transferred between application layer services.                                                                                               |
| 5 - Session     | The session layer provides services to the presentation layer to organize its dialogue and to manage data exchange.                                                                                                 |
| 4 - Transport   | The transport layer defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications between the end devices.                                                                           |
| 3 - Network     | The network layer provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network between identified end devices.                                                                                      |
| 2 - Data Link   | The data link layer protocols describe methods for exchanging data frames between devices over a common media.                                                                                                      |
| 1 - Physical    | The physical layer protocols describe the mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural means to activate, maintain, and de-activate physical connections for a bit transmission to and from a network device. |
