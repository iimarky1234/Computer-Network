## 1. Peer-to-Peer Networks:
*P2P network* is one computer acts as client and server at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network.

The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers either a wired or a wireless connection. Both computers are then able to use this simple network to exchange data and services with each other, acting as either a client or a server as necessary.

##### The advantages of P2P network:
- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
- Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

##### The disadvantages of P2P network:
- No centralized administration
- Not as secure
- Not scalable
- All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance

## 2. P2P Application:
A P2P Application allows a device to act as both a client and server within the same communication, as shown in the figure. In this model, every client is a server and every server is a client. P2P application require that each end device provide a user interface and run a background service.

Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized.
