## 1. ISP Services:
An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides the link between the home network and the internet.   
ISPs are critical to communications across the global internet. Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network of links that interconnect users all over the world. ISPs are connected in a hierarchical manner that ensures that internet traffic generally takes the shortest path from the source to the destination.

## 3. Cable and DSL Connections:
Most home network users do not connect to their service providers with fiber-optic cables. The two common methods are as follow:

- **Cable -** Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television. It provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. A special cable modem separates the internet data signal from the the other signals carried on the cable and provide an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.
- **DSL - Digital Subscriber Line** provides high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. It requires a special high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN. DSL runs over a telephone line, with the line split into three channels. One channel is used for voice telephone calls. This channel allows an individual to receive phone calls without disconnecting from the internet. A second channel is a faster download channel, used to receive information from the internet. The third channel is used for sending or uploading information. This channel is usually slightly slower than the download channel. The quality and speed of the DSL connection depends mainly on the quality of the phone line and the distance from the central office of your phone company The farther you are from the central office, the slower the connection.
