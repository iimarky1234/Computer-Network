## 1. The fields of the Ethernet frame:

| Field | Preamble | Start frame deumiter | Destination MAC | Source MAC | Length/ Type | Data    | Frame Check Sequence |
| ----- | -------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------- | -------------------- |
| Byte  | 7        | 1                    | 6               | 6          | 2            | 46-1500 | 4                    |
## 2. Encapsulation:
The process of placing one message format (the letter) inside another message format (the envelope) is called encapsulation. De-encapsulation occurs when the process is reversed by the recipient and the letter is removed from the envelop. Just as a letter is encapsulated in a envelop for delivery, so computer messages are encapsulated.

Each computer message is encapsulated in a specific format, called a frame, before it is sent over the internet. A frame acts like an envelope; it provides the address of the intended destination and the address of the source host. The format and contents of a frame are determined by the type of message being sent and the channel over which it is communicated. Messages that are not correctly formatted are not successfully delivered to or processed by the destination host.
