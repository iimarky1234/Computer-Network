## 1. Ethernet Switches:
Ethernet switches operate at the layer two - data link layer of the OSI model. That's because they make their forwarding decisions based on the layer two information: the Ethernet header information of the Ethernet frame.
Ethernet switches have MAC address tables.

## 2. MAC Address Tables:
A Switch makes it's forwarding decision based on layer two information.

So let's take a look at how this switch builds. It's MAC address table. On these four hosts, I have abbreviated MAC addresses: AA-AA through DD-DD.
So here we're going to have H1 send an Ethernet frame to H4, so the source MAC address will be AA-AA aka the MAC address of H1's Ethernet NIC and the destination address will be that of H4's Ethernet NIC, DD-DD.
