## 1. Bandwidth:
Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:
- Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
- Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
- Billions of bits per second (Gbps)

| Unit of bandwidth   | Abbreviation | Equivalence                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Bits per second     | bps          | 1 bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth           |
| Kilobits per second | Kbps         | 1 Kbps = 1,000 bps = $10^3$ bps                 |
| Megabits per second | Mbps         | 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps = $10^6$ bps             |
| Gigabits per second | Gbps         | 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = $10^9$ bps         |
| Terabits per second | Tbps         | 1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = $10^1$$^2$ bps |

## 2. Throughput:
Like bandwidth, throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time. ==It is the amount of data that a computer or network device can process in a specific unit of time==. It is also used to represent data processing capacity and data transmission speed.

Throughput doesn't usually match the specified bandwidth. Many factors influence throughput including:
- The amount of data being sent and received over the connection.
- The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination.
