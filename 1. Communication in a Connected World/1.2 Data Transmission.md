## 1. Types of Personal Data:

| Types          | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Volunteer Data | is data that you offer yourself. You realize the data is collected about you and you agreed to share your data.                                      |
| Inferred data  | is data that created by your activities. For example, like your credit card. Whenever you buy something through your credit card. It'll leave a log. |
| Observed data  |                                                                                                                                                      |

## 2. The Bit:
Computer uses binary codes to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with bits. A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). With ASCII, each character is represented by 8 bits. For example:
- Capital letter: A = 01000001
- Number: 9 = 00111001
- Special Character:  # = 00100011

Each group of 8 bits is known as byte

## 3. Common Methods of Data Transmission:
- **Electrical signals -** Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- **Optical signals -** Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- **Wireless signals -** Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air

*In most homes and small businesses, network signals are transmitted across copper wires (cables) or Wi-Fi enabled wireless connections. Larger networks employ fiber-optic cables in order to reliably carry signals for longer distances.*
