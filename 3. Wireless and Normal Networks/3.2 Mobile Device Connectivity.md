## 1. Mobile Devices and Wi-Fi:
Almost all mobile devices are capable of connecting to Wi-Fi networks. It is advisable to connect to Wi-Fi networks when possible because data used over Wi-Fi does not count against the cellular data plan. Also, because Wi-Fi radios use less power than cellular radios, connecting to Wi-Fi networks conserves battery power. Like other Wi-Fi-enabled devices, it is important to use security when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. These precautions should be taken to protect Wi-Fi communications on mobile devices:

- Never send login or password information using unencrypted text (plaintext).
- Use a VPN connection when possible if you are sending sensitive data.
- Enable security on home networks.
- Use WPA2 or higher encryption for security.

## 2. Wi-Fi Settings:
Two of the most popular OS for mobile devices are Android and Apple IOS. Each OS has settings that enable you to configure your device to connect to wireless networks.

To connect an Android or IOS device when it is within the coverage range of a Wi-Fi network, turn on Wi-Fi and the device then searches for all available Wi-Fi networks and displays them in a list. Touch a Wi-Fi network in the list to connect. Enter the password if needed.

## 3. Configure Mobile Wi-Fi Connectivity:
If your mobile device does not prompt to connect to a Wi-Fi network, the network SSID broadcast may be turned off, or the device may not be set to connect automatically. Manually configure the Wi-Fi settings on the mobile devices.

## 4. Configure Cellular Data Settings:
Cellular data plans are offered by most cell phone carriers, but the bandwidth limitations and charges for usage vary widely by carrier, and by plan within carriers. As a result, many mobile device users only use their cellular data plans when Wi-Fi service is not available.

Mobile devices are preprogrammed to use a Wi-Fi network for internet if one is available and the device can connect to the access point and receive an IP address. If no Wi-Fi network is available, the device uses the cellular data capability if it is configured. Most of the time, transitions from one network to another are not obvious to the user. For example, as a mobile device moves from an area of 4G coverage to 3G coverage, the 4G radio shuts off and turns on the 3G radio. Connections are not lost during this transition.

## 6. Simple Connectivity with Bluetooth:

Up to eight Bluetooth devices can be connected together at any one time.

These are some examples of how devices use Bluetooth:

- **Hands-free headset** - A small earpiece with a microphone can be used for making and receiving calls.
- **Keyboard or mouse** - A keyboard or mouse can be connected to a mobile device to make input easier.
- **Stereo control** - A mobile device can connect to a home or car stereo to play music.
- **Car speakerphone** - A device that contains a speaker and a microphone can be used for making and receiving calls.
- **Tethering** - A mobile device can connect to another mobile device or computer to share a network connection. Tethering can also be performed with a Wi-Fi connection or a cable connection such as USB.
- **Mobile speaker** - Portable speakers can connect to mobile devices to provide high-quality audio without a stereo system

## 7. Bluetooth Pairing:
Bluetooth pairing occurs when 2 Bluetooth devices establish a connection to share resources. In order for the devices to pair, the Bluetooth radios are turned on, and one device begins searching for other devices. Other devices must be set to discoverable mode, also called visible, so that they can be detected. When a Bluetooth device is in discoverable mode, it transmit the following information when another Bluetooth device requests it:
- Name
- Bluetooth class
- Services that the device can use
- Technical Information, such as the features or the Bluetooth specification that it supports

During the pairing process, a personal identification number (PIN) may be requested to authenticate the pairing process. The PIN is often a number, but can also be a numeric code or passkey. The PIN is stored using pairing services, so it does not have to be entered the next time the device tries to connect.
