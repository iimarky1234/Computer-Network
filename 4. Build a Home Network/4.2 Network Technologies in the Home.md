## 1. LAN Wiresless Frequencies:
*The wireless technologies* most frequently used in home networks are in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges
*Bluetooth* is a technology that makes use of the 2.4 GHz band. It is limited to low-speed, short-range communications, bust has the advantage of communicating with many devices at the same time. Bluetooth is a good method for transmitting audio to speakers or headphones.
*Other technologies that use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands are the modern wireless LAN technologies that conform to the various IEEE 802.11 standards. Unlike Bluetooth technology, 802.11 devices transmit at a much higher power level giving them a great range and improved throughput. Certain areas of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used without a permit.*

| Category 5e Cable | is the most common wiring used in a LAN. The cable is made up of 4 pairs of wires that are twisted to reduce electrical interference.![[Pasted image 20250911200203.png]]                                                                                                                        |
| Coaxial Cable     | has an inner wire surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, that is then surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Most coax cables also have an external insulating sheath or jacket.                         ![[Pasted image 20250911200333.png]]                                             |
| Fiber-Optic Cable | can be either glass or plastic with a diameter about the same as a human hair and it can carry digital information at very high speeds over long distances. Fiber-optic cables have a very high bandwidth, which enables them to carry large amounts of data![[Pasted image 20250911200957.png]] |
